# react-native-scrollview-carousel-example

The simplest carousel example in React Native using the built-in ScrollView in
horizontal mode.

## Setting up the development environment

Install the Expo CLI command line utility:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/navarroaxel/react-native-scrollview-carousel-example.git
cd react-native-scrollview-carousel-example
npm install
```

## Trying the example app

Start the local dev server for the app:

```bash
npm start
```

Then, follow the expo instructions to open the app in your phone or emulator.

## How does ScrollView work?

The ScrollView renders all its react child components vertically, but we can
arrange them horizontally in a row using:

```jsx
<ScrollView horizontal>
```

In this example, we show how to overlap the `Image` component on the header
to get a cool effect. The touch is so fluid and fast that the user has a sense
of a highly performance application.

### Performance issues

The `ScrollView` renders all its react child components. If you need to render
a carousel with more than 10 items, you can get better performance by using the
`FlatList` built-in component.

## The layout

### Header

We will call the `View` number 1 "Header", this should have a fixed height
because the `ScrollView` extends himself with a `flex: 1` style.

:bulb: You can use a proportional height based on the device screen using the
`useWindowDimensions` hook.

```jsx
const {height} = useWindowDimensions();
```

### ScrollView

The `ScrollView` is the number 2, I used a `marginTop: -70` to overlap the
carousel on the header for a cool effect. :sunglasses:

### Carousel Itme

The `View` number 3 is the "Carousel Item". I used a carousel of images because
is the most use case for carousels in real life.

:bulb: A tool to create the image's shadow:

Don't worry about this loop:

```javascript
Array.apply(null, Array(6)).map((_, index) => ( /* ... */ ));
```

This is just the functional form to:

```javascript
for (i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    items.push( /* ... */ );
}
```

Every item has a `marginLeft: 70` to start in the middle of the screen. But
for the last item we should use `marginRight` to end with the same margin:

```javascript
lastItem: {
  marginLeft: 70,
  marginRight: 70,
},
```

### The item content

The `View` number 4 is a placeholder for the text associated with the image.
This style is required to keep everything centered in the `View` number 3 - the
carousel item.

```javascript
itemContent: {
  flex: 1,
  alignItems: 'center',
  justifyContent: 'center',
},
itemText: {
  textAlign: 'center',
},
```
